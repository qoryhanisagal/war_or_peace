Purpose of the Class: The CardGenerator class is designed to convert card data from a text file into Card objects. It ensures that we’re not hardcoding the cards directly in our runner, making the program more flexible and modular.

How It Works:

The class takes a filename (cards.txt) as input.
It reads the file line by line using File.readlines, splitting each line into value, suit, and rank.
Each line represents one card, which gets turned into a Card object.
The generate_cards method returns an array of Card objects, which is stored in the @cards instance variable.
Why It’s Important:

This method allows us to easily modify the deck of cards just by editing the text file.
It decouples the card creation logic from the game logic, adhering to good software design principles like Separation of Concerns.
