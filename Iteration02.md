# Iteration 2 - War or Peace

## Objective 
Create the foundational `Turn` class for the War or Peace game/

## Step by Step Questions & Notes:
## Turn Class

### Test Failures in Iteration 1 `turn.rb and turn_spec.rb`
#### 1. `turn.rb` failures
- Main Issue:

My initialize method is defined outside the Turn class, which is causing the end keyword to be mismatched.

- Correcting the Code:

	1.	Move the initialize method inside the Turn class.
	2.	Make sure proper indentation for readability and correctness.
