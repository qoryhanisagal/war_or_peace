# Iteration 1 - War or Peace

## Objective 
Create the foundational `Card` and `Deck` classes for the War or Peace game/

## Step by Step Questions & Notes:
1. Create the `Card` class, which represents a single playing card.
    - The `Card` class has three attributes: `rank`, `suit`, and `value`.
    - Used `attr_reader` to create getter methods for these attributes.
    - Defined an `initialize` method to assign values to `ran`, `suit`, and `value`
    - Added comments in the code to explain each line ðŸ˜© I am still learning. 
    - Next Step, I need to test the `Card` class to make sure it work by writing a test. I will use the test file that loaded in the repository.
2. Test the Card Class
    - The test file was laready created.
